    <h4 style="text-indent: 70px">
    	Charlie’s Cherry Cheese Chowder was founded in 1974 by Charlie Chubb in South Bend, Indiana.
      Yearning to create a soup that blended the taste of sweet cherries with mozzarella cheese,
      Charlie concocted the recipe over the course of 10 days within the kitchen of his small Indiana bungalow home.</h4>
    <h4 style="text-indent: 70px"> The first person to try the soup was his wife Georgia, whom upon first taste, said to him “This is the best soup ever!
        Cherries and cheese in one delectable bowl tastes just amazing!”  Charlie knew he had a million-dollar recipe.
        25 years later, Charlie’s Cherry Cheese Chowder is the most loved soup in the world.</h4>
